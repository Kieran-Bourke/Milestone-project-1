 ## Known Bugs
    - Tabs being cut of on mobile - possible soloution is to segemnt the images to help it stack for mobile.
	- Audio not being correct - this can be fixed by either gaining accese to the songs without copyright or by produceing a cover of the song.
	- The contact form currently dosent go anywhere - this can be fixed by adding a data base to connect it to. 
	- The navigation links in the header are not centerd.
	- The social icons sit incorectly while on mobile devices.
	- Guitar types do not have names as it caused stacking issues.
	- Gutiar types images are not correct as I couldnt find non copyright images of those specific types.
	- Guitar types images do not show the guitars on mobile as the positioning is off.
    - Footer on contact page rises up on larger screen sizes.

## Problems I had 

---
    
#### Widths 
    An issue I ran into while working on the index.html page was the overview texts width, I had it set to 33% originally but this caused issues with sizing. 
	I fixed this by making it fit-content and this gave me the look I wanted. 

#### Resposive Nav Bar
    I wanted to create a responsive nav bar for mobile that would shrink down into a hamburger icon. This caused a lot of issues as it involved jquery which is something I had 
	no experiance with. It took me a long time to even know what to google but I eventualy found a stack overflow post(link in the credits section) that explained what I needed and 
	how to implement it. This problem taught me that how you phrase your question can give you different results on google search. 

#### Side Scrolling
    When I added a bootstrap form onto contact.html It caused side scrolling. I was unsure how to remove it but also wanted to keep using the bootstrap as it saved me alot of time.
	This caused me to search for a soloution on stack overflow where I quickly found a soloution that I would not of figured out on my own without alot of time and effort. This taught me 
	that stack overflow covers a large amount of topics and that you can find a soloution to almost any problem. 

#### Z-Index
    I ran into a issue where the easy songs secion of my site would cover the images. This confused me as I had no idea why this was happening. I then rememberd a lesson on z-indexing
	that allowed me to solve the problem by giving the types section a z-index of 1 and a z-index of 0 to easy songs section.
