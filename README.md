## Problems I had  

---     

#### Widths  

   - An issue I ran into while working on the index.html page was the overview texts width, I had it set to 33% originally but this caused issues with sizing.  
        I fixed this by making it fit-content and this gave me the look I wanted.   
 

#### Responsive Nav Bar 

  -  I wanted to create a responsive nav bar for mobile that would shrink down into a hamburger icon. This caused a lot of issues as it involved jQuery which is something I had no experience with. It took me a long time to even know what to google but I eventually found a stack overflow post (link in the credits section) that explained what I needed and how to implement it. This problem taught me that how you phrase your question can give you different results on google search.   
 

#### Side Scrolling 

  - When I added a bootstrap form onto contact.html It caused side scrolling. I was unsure how to remove it but also wanted to keep using the bootstrap as it saved me a lot of time. This caused me to search for a solution on stack overflow where I quickly found a solution that I would not have figured out on my own without a lot of time and effort. This taught me that stack overflow covers a large number of topics and that you can find a solution to almost any problem.   
 

#### Z-Index 

   - I ran into a issue where the easy songs section of my site would cover the images. This confused me as I had no idea why this was happening. I then remembered a lesson on z-indexing that allowed me to solve the problem by giving the types section a z-index of 1 and a z-index of 0 to easy songs section.  
 

## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository 


By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...  

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/) 

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button. 

3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account. 
 

### Making a Local Clone  

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/) 

2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download". 

3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link. 

4. Open Git Bash 

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. 

6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. 


``` 

$ git clone https://github.com/Kieran-Bourke/Milestone-project-1.git

``` 

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.  

```  

$ git clone https://github.com/Kieran-Bourke/Milestone-project-1.git

>  Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
